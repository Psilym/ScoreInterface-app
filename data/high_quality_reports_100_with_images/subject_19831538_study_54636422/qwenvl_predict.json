  "findings": "- **Both Lung Fields**: Both lung fields show diffuse, patchy, and nodular shadows, distributed widely with uneven density, with some areas showing fusion, resembling a \"ground-glass\" appearance.\n- **Right Lung**: Lesions in the middle and lower fields of the right lung are more prominent, with multiple nodular shadows visible, some of which are fused and have blurred edges.\n- **Left Lung**: Lesions in the middle and lower fields of the left lung are also prominent, with similar nodular shadows visible, some of which show ground-glass changes.\n- **Mediastinum**: The mediastinal structures are clear, with no obvious enlarged lymph nodes.\n- **Heart**: The heart size and shape are normal, with no obvious abnormalities.\n- **Diaphragm**: The diaphragm is smooth and in its normal position.\n- **Pleura**: There is no evidence of pleural effusion or pleural thickening.\n- **Bones**: The thoracic cage is symmetrical, with no obvious fractures or abnormalities in the ribs, spine, or thoracic vertebrae.",
  "impression": "- **Infectious Diseases**: Consider infectious lesions such as viral pneumonia (e.g., pneumonia related to COVID-19), bacterial pneumonia, or fungal pneumonia.\n- **Interstitial Lung Diseases**: Exclude interstitial pneumonia or interstitial lung disease (e.g., idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis).\n- **Tumor Diseases**: Exclude metastatic tumors or diffuse lung tumor diseases.\n- **Others**: Further clarify the diagnosis based on clinical symptoms, laboratory tests, and other imaging examinations (such as CT). It is recommended to further complete the medical history, laboratory tests, and high-resolution CT examinations to clarify the cause.",
