  "findings": "- Cardiomegaly with a cardiothoracic ratio exceeding 50%, suggesting an enlarged heart.\n- Prominent pulmonary vasculature with increased vascular markings bilaterally, particularly in the upper lobes.\n- Evidence of bilateral pleural effusion with fluid levels visible in the costophrenic angles and extending into the lower lung fields.\n- Blunting of the costophrenic angles bilaterally, consistent with fluid accumulation.\n- No visible lung consolidation or lobar collapse.\n- No significant mediastinal shift or deviation.\n- No obvious fractures or bony abnormalities in the thoracic cage.\n- No visible pneumothorax or subcutaneous emphysema.\n- Diaphragm appears elevated on the right side, possibly due to volume loss or diaphragmatic paralysis.",
  "impression": "- Congestive heart failure with pulmonary edema and bilateral pleural effusions.\n- Possible chronic pulmonary hypertension contributing to pulmonary vascular congestion.\n- Right diaphragmatic elevation may suggest diaphragmatic dysfunction or volume loss secondary to chronic lung disease or effusion.\n- No acute pulmonary infection or pneumothorax identified.",
