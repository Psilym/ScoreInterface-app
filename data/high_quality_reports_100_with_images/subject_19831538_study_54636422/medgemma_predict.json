  "findings": ":**\n\n*   **Cardiomediastinal Silhouette:** The heart size appears within normal limits. The mediastinal contours are unremarkable.\n*   **Lungs:** There is a large, well-defined opacity in the right lower lung field, likely representing a pleural effusion. The opacity obscures the right hemidiaphragm and heart border. The left lung appears relatively clear, although there might be subtle increased interstitial markings.\n*   **Pleura:** The right pleural effusion is significant, causing blunting of the right costophrenic angle and potentially compressing the right lung.\n*   **Bones:** No acute osseous abnormalities are identified.\n*   **Other:** A nasogastric tube is partially visualized, extending into the stomach.\n\n**",
  "impression": "s:**\n\n1.  **Large Right-sided Pleural Effusion:** This is the most prominent finding. Further investigation (e.g., thoracentesis, CT scan) is warranted to determine the etiology (transudative vs. exudative) and clinical significance.\n2.  **Possible Left Lung Interstitial Changes:** Subtle changes may be present, but are less definitive than the right-sided effusion. Correlation with clinical history and other imaging may be needed.",
