  "findings": "- **Chest Wall:** No significant abnormalities noted in the ribcage or sternum.\n- **Cardiomegaly:** There is no evidence of cardiomegaly.\n- **Heart:** The heart silhouette is within normal limits, with no obvious enlargement or distortion.\n- **Lung Fields:** The lung fields are clear bilaterally, with no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.\n- **Airways:** The airways appear to be well preserved with no significant narrowing.\n- **Cardiovascular:** The aorta is not enlarged, and the pulmonary arteries are not dilated.\n- **Electrocardiogram Leads:** There are two leads visible on the right side of the chest, likely part of a portable semi-erect device.\n- **Electrodes:** There are two electrodes attached to the skin, one on the right upper chest and one on the left upper chest.",
  "impression": "- **Key Diagnostic Possibilities:**\n  - The patient is likely being monitored for cardiac conditions with a portable semi-erect device.\n  - The electrodes and leads suggest that the patient may be undergoing cardiac monitoring or pacing.\n  - There are no acute cardiac abnormalities noted on this chest X-ray.\n  - Further evaluation with a full cardiac workup, including an electrocardiogram (ECG), may be warranted to assess cardiac rhythm and function.\n  - Clinical correlation is essential to determine the indication for the portable semi-erect device and to guide further management.\n---",
