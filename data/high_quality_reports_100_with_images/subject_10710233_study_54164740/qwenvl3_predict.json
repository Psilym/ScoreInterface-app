  "findings": "- Cardiomegaly with prominent cardiac silhouette.\n- Bilateral pulmonary infiltrates with patchy opacities predominantly in the lower lung zones.\n- Pleural effusions bilaterally, more pronounced on the right side.\n- Evidence of central venous catheter placement with tubing coursing into the superior vena cava.\n- Presence of a transvenous pacemaker with leads visible in the right atrium and ventricle.\n- Mildly displaced mediastinum with slight deviation to the left.\n- No obvious pneumothorax or rib fractures.\n- Diaphragm appears elevated, particularly on the right side.\n- No visible lung nodules or masses.\n- Abdominal organs are partially obscured by the overlying cardiac silhouette and fluid.",
  "impression": "- Likely acute exacerbation of heart failure with pulmonary edema.\n- Bilateral pleural effusions secondary to cardiac dysfunction.\n- Possible right-sided tension or large pleural effusion contributing to mediastinal shift.\n- Patient has a history of cardiac device implantation (pacemaker) and central venous access, consistent with chronic cardiac disease.\n- No evidence of acute pulmonary embolism or pneumonia on this imaging.\n- Consideration of diuretic therapy and further cardiac evaluation.",
