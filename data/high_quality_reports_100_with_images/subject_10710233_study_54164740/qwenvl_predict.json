  "findings": "- **Overall Chest**: The patient is in a semi-recumbent position, with symmetrical chest contours and the mediastinal structures are approximately centered.\n- **Heart**: The heart size is normal, with a generally regular shape, and there is no significant enlargement or displacement.\n- **Lungs**:\n  - The lung markings are clear and evenly distributed, with no obvious signs of exudate, consolidation, or nodular shadows.\n  - There is a small amount of hazy shadow in the lower right lung, which may suggest mild inflammation or effusion.\n- **Diaphragm**: The diaphragm is smooth and positioned approximately normally, with the right diaphragm slightly elevated, which may be related to the patient's position.\n- **Pleura and Pleural Cavity**: There is no evidence of pleural effusion or pneumothorax.\n- **Bones**: The thoracic cage is symmetrical, with no visible fractures or deformities in the ribs, spine, or thoracic vertebrae.\n- **Implants**:\n  - A pacemaker device is visible in the right chest wall, with normal positioning and clear electrode wires.\n  - The pacemaker pocket is unremarkable, with no surrounding fluid collection or signs of infection.\n- **Trachea and Bronchi**: The trachea is centered, with normal bronchial passage, and there is no evidence of narrowing or displacement.\n- **Gastric Bubble**: The gastric bubble is clearly visible, with normal positioning, and there is no evidence of dilation or abnormality.",
  "impression": "- **Post-implantation pacemaker surgery**: The patient has an implanted pacemaker, and the device and leads are in normal position with no significant complications.\n- **Right lower lung mild abnormality**: There is a small, slightly hazy shadow in the right lower lung. Further clinical symptoms and additional tests (such as CT) are needed to determine if this is inflammation, fluid accumulation, or another abnormality.\n- **No significant pleural effusion or pneumothorax**: There is no evidence of pleural effusion or pneumothorax, but further clinical assessment is needed.\n- **No significant fractures or deformities**: The bone structure is normal, with no signs of fractures or deformities.\n\nIt is recommended to combine clinical symptoms and further tests (such as CT and ultrasound) to clarify the nature of the hazy shadow in the right lower lung, while monitoring the function of the pacemaker and the overall condition of the patient.",
