The opacity obscures the right heart border and extends towards the hilum. There is also evidence of volume loss in the right hemithorax, suggested by the elevation of the right hemidiaphragm and the shift of the mediastinum towards the right.\n*   **Left Lung:** The left lung appears relatively clear, although there might be subtle increased interstitial markings.\n*   **Mediastinum:** The mediastinum is shifted towards the right.\n*   **Pleura:** No large pleural effusion is identified, although a small effusion on the right cannot be entirely excluded.\n*   **Bones:** The visualized bony structures appear intact.\n*   **Other:** An electronic device (likely a heart rate monitor) is seen overlying the left chest wall.\n\n**",
