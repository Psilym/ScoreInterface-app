  "findings": "- **Breast Overall**: The breasts are symmetrical, and the mediastinal structures are roughly centered.\n- **Lungs**:\n  - There is increased and thickened lung texture, with diffuse patchy and nodular shadows, distributed widely, with uneven density, and some areas are fused.\n  - The middle and lower fields of the right lung and the lower fields of the left lung show more obvious lesions, with a ground-glass appearance, and some areas show consolidation shadows.\n- **Heart**: The heart size is normal, and there are no obvious abnormalities in shape.\n- **Diaphragm**: The diaphragm is smooth on both sides, and the position is normal.\n- **Ribs and Chest Wall**: There are no obvious fractures or abnormalities in the ribs and chest wall.\n- **Trachea and Bronchi**: The trachea is centered, and the bronchi are normally positioned, with no obvious narrowing or obstruction.\n- **Mediastinum**: The mediastinal structures are clear, with no obvious enlargement or abnormal density shadows.\n- **Subdiaphragmatic Area**: There is no free gas or fluid level under the diaphragm, and there are no obvious abnormalities in the abdominal cavity.",
  "impression": "**Key Diagnostic Possibilities**:\n1. **Pneumonia**: Consider infectious pneumonia, with diffuse distribution and uneven density, which is consistent with either bacterial or viral pneumonia.\n2. **Interstitial Lung Disease**: The lesions are diffuse in distribution, with some areas showing a ground-glass appearance, which requires further exclusion of interstitial pneumonia.\n3. **Tuberculosis**: This needs to be evaluated in conjunction with clinical history and laboratory tests. The distribution characteristics of the lesions need further assessment.\n4. **Allergic Pneumonia or Other Inflammatory Diseases**: This should be further investigated based on clinical symptoms and a history of allergies.\n\nIt is recommended to conduct a comprehensive assessment based on clinical symptoms, laboratory tests (such as blood routine, CRP, PCT, and pathogen testing), and further imaging tests (such as CT scans) to confirm the diagnosis.",
