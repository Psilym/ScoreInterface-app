  "findings": "- **Chest Wall**: The ribcage appears symmetrical with no obvious abnormalities.\n- **Lung Fields**: The left lung field shows a slightly increased opacity in the upper lobe, which could be due to a pleural effusion or consolidation. The right lung field is clear with no significant abnormalities.\n- **Cardiomegaly**: There is no evidence of cardiomegaly or significant cardiac enlargement.\n- **Diaphragm**: The diaphragm is not clearly visualized due to the patient's position and the quality of the image.\n- **Airways**: The airways appear to be patent with no evidence of significant narrowing or obstruction.\n- **Chest Tubes**: There are two chest tubes inserted in the right lung field, one in the 4th intercostal space and the other in the 5th intercostal space, extending laterally.\n- **Posterior Structures**: The posterior structures are not clearly visualized due to the patient's position and the quality of the image.",
  "impression": "- **Key Diagnostic Possibilities**: The chest X-ray shows bilateral pleural effusion with the left side being more prominent. There are two chest tubes in place, which may suggest recent thoracic surgery or the management of a pleural effusion. The patient's clinical history and additional imaging studies would be necessary to confirm the diagnosis and guide further management.",
