  "findings": "- **Overall Chest**: The lung fields show reduced transparency bilaterally, with diffuse and patchy shadows that are unevenly distributed, mainly concentrated in the lower lobes of both lungs.\n- **Pulmonary Vessels**: The pulmonary vessels appear thickened and blurred, with some areas showing linear shadows.\n- **Heart**: The heart size is normal, and there are no obvious abnormalities in its shape.\n- **Mediastinum**: The mediastinal structures are clear, with no significant widening or displacement.\n- **Diaphragm**: The diaphragm is smooth, in the correct position, and there is no obvious elevation.\n- **Ribs and Chest Wall**: There are no visible fractures or other abnormalities in the ribs and chest wall.\n- **Trachea**: The trachea is centered, with no significant deviation.\n- **Chest Cavity**: There is no evidence of pleural effusion or pneumothorax.",
  "impression": "**Key Diagnostic Possibilities**:\n1. **Pneumonia**: Diffuse patchy shadows in both lungs, indicative of an infectious lesion. Further investigation of the causative organism is required.\n2. **Interstitial Lung Disease**: Coarse and blurred lung markings, with some areas showing linear shadows. This should be correlated with clinical symptoms and further investigation (such as high-resolution CT).\n3. **Pulmonary Edema**: This should be evaluated in conjunction with the patient's clinical history and cardiac function assessment to rule out cardiogenic or non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema.\n4. **Sarcoidosis or Granulomatous Disease**: This should be correlated with clinical manifestations and further investigation (such as pulmonary function tests and serological tests).\n5. **Other Diffuse Lung Diseases**: Such as alveolar proteinosis or alveolar hemorrhage syndrome, further investigation is required to clarify the diagnosis.\n\nIt is recommended to consider the clinical symptoms, medical history, and laboratory test results, and to perform a high-resolution CT scan when necessary for further assessment.",
