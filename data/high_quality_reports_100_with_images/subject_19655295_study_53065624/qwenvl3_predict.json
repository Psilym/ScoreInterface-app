  "findings": "- Cardiomegaly with a cardiothoracic ratio exceeding 50%, suggesting an enlarged heart silhouette.\n- Bilateral pleural effusions, evident as homogeneous opacities in the lower lung fields, obscuring the costophrenic angles bilaterally.\n- Moderate to large volume of fluid accumulation, with the right-sided effusion appearing more prominent.\n- No significant consolidation or infiltrates noted within the lung parenchyma.\n- Mediastinal shift is not apparent; trachea remains midline.\n- No visible pneumothorax or subcutaneous emphysema.\n- Bony thorax appears intact with no fractures or deformities.\n- Diaphragmatic contour is blunted bilaterally, consistent with fluid accumulation.\n- No obvious signs of pulmonary edema or parenchymal disease.",
  "impression": "- Bilateral pleural effusions with right-sided predominance.\n- Cardiomegaly suggestive of underlying cardiac pathology.\n- Consider cardiac failure as a primary etiology, particularly given the combination of cardiomegaly and pleural effusions.\n- Rule out malignancy or infection as secondary causes of pleural effusion.\n- Recommend further evaluation with echocardiography and possibly thoracentesis for fluid analysis.\n---",
