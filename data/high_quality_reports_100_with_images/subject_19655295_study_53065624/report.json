The right lower lung opacity\n projecting above the effusion demostrates a fluffy appearance more concerning\n for pneumonia or aspiration.  There has been interval near-complete resolution\n of the left perihilar opacity.  No pneumothorax is seen.  Heart size is\n difficult to evaluate in the setting of these overlying opacities.",
