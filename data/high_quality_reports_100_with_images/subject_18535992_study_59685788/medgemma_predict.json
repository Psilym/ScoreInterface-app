  "findings": ":**\n\n*   **Opacities:** There are bilateral, predominantly lower lobe, airspace opacities. These appear somewhat patchy and ill-defined. The right lower lobe opacity seems more extensive than the left.\n*   **Distribution:** The opacities are not clearly localized to one specific area but are widespread, particularly in the lung bases.\n*   **Other Structures:** The cardiac silhouette appears normal in size. The mediastinal structures are unremarkable. No pleural effusions or pneumothorax are evident. The bony structures appear intact.\n\n**",
  "impression": "s:**\n\n*   The bilateral lower lobe predominant airspace opacities are concerning for an infectious process, such as pneumonia (possibly atypical or viral given the pattern), or potentially other inflammatory conditions like acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or pulmonary edema, although the latter is less likely without other supporting signs like cardiomegaly or pleural effusions. Further clinical correlation and potentially follow-up imaging are recommended.",
