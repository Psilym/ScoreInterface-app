  "findings": "- **Overall Chest**: Reduced transparency of both lung fields, with diffuse patchy and nodular shadows, widely distributed and uneven in density.\n- **Both Lungs**: Multiple, varying in size, nodular shadows are visible in both lung fields, some of which are fused, with unclear borders, and high density, mainly distributed in the middle and lower lung fields.\n- **Mediastinum**: The mediastinal structures are clearly visible, without significant widening or displacement.\n- **Heart**: The heart size and shape are normal, with no obvious abnormalities.\n- **Diaphragm**: The diaphragm is smooth, in the correct position, without significant elevation or depression.\n- **Ribs and Chest Wall**: There are no obvious abnormalities in the ribs and chest wall bone structure, and no obvious soft tissue masses or abnormal density shadows.\n- **Trachea and Bronchi**: The trachea is centered, and the bronchi show no signs of narrowing or obstruction.\n- **Costophrenic Angles**: Both costophrenic angles are sharp, without any blurring or rounding.",
