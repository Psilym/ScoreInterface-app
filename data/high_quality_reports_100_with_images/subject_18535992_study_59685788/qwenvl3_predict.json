  "findings": "- Cardiomegaly with an enlarged cardiac silhouette, suggesting increased cardiac size.\n- Bilateral pleural effusions, with fluid levels visible in both costophrenic angles, appearing as blunting and opacification.\n- Increased opacity in the lower lung zones bilaterally, consistent with consolidation or interstitial infiltrates, particularly prominent in the dependent regions.\n- Visible central venous catheter tip located in the superior vena cava, with associated tubing extending to the right atrium.\n- Multiple subcutaneous wires and leads, including pacing wires and/or defibrillator leads, coursing across the chest wall and terminating in the cardiac chambers.\n- Mild mediastinal shift to the left, possibly secondary to volume overload or asymmetric pleural effusions.\n- No obvious pneumothorax or rib fractures.\n- Diaphragmatic contour appears flattened, especially on the right side, likely due to volume overload or pleural effusion.\n- Lung fields show no evidence of focal consolidation or mass lesions.\n- No visible signs of acute pulmonary embolism or pneumomediastinum.",
  "impression": "- Cardiomegaly with bilateral pleural effusions and bilateral lower lobe infiltrates, suggestive of heart failure or systemic inflammatory process.\n- Presence of cardiac implantable electronic device leads and central venous catheter, consistent with a patient with chronic cardiac disease or recent intervention.\n- Consideration of acute decompensated heart failure with pulmonary edema and pleural effusions.\n- Differential diagnoses include sepsis with pulmonary involvement, systemic inflammatory response, or malignancy with pleural involvement.\n- No evidence of acute trauma or pneumothorax.\n---",
