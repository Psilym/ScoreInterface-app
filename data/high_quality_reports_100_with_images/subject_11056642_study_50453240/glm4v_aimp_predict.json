  "findings": "- **Chest Wall**: The chest wall appears symmetrical with no obvious abnormalities.\n- **Lung Fields**: The left lung field shows a marked volume loss with a blunted costophrenic angle, indicative of a collapsed lung. The right lung field is clear with no signs of volume loss.\n- **Cardiomegaly**: There is no evidence of cardiomegaly.\n- **Pleural Effusion**: There is no pleural effusion.\n- **Airway**: The airways appear patent with no evidence of stridor or narrowing.\n- **Ribs**: The ribs are well defined with no obvious fractures.\n- **Diaphragm**: The diaphragm is not clearly visible due to the overlapping structures.",
  "impression": "- **Key Diagnostic Possibilities**:\n  - **Left Lung Collapse**: The most likely diagnosis is a left lung collapse, which could be due to a pleural effusion, mass, or other pleural pathology.\n  - **Cardiopulmonary Disease**: Given the volume loss in the left lung, there could be underlying cardiopulmonary disease that needs to be investigated.\n  - **Pleural Pathology**: There could be pleural pathology such as a pleural effusion, mass, or pleural plaques that are not clearly visible on this X-ray.\n  - **Other Considerations**: There could be other less likely causes of the left lung collapse, such as spontaneous pneumothorax, foreign body aspiration, or other infectious processes.\n\nPlease note that this impression is based solely on the provided chest X-ray image and does not include clinical information. A thorough clinical evaluation and additional imaging studies may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis and plan further management.",
