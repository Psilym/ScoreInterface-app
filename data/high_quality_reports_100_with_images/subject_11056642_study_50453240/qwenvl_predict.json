  "findings": "- **Breast Overall**: The breasts are symmetric, and the mediastinum is centered.\n- **Lungs**:\n  - Both lung fields show diffuse patchy and nodular shadows, distributed widely, with uneven density, some of which are fused. The main concentration is in the middle and lower lung fields.\n  - A large nodule shadow is visible in the upper left lung, with blurred edges and high density. Surrounding it, there is a hazy appearance.\n  - Scattered patchy shadows are visible in the upper right lung field, with lighter density.\n- **Heart**: The heart size is approximately normal, with no obvious abnormalities in shape.\n- **Diaphragm**: The diaphragm is smooth, with a normal position.\n- **Ribs and Chest Wall**: There are no obvious fractures or other abnormalities in the ribs and chest wall.\n- **Trachea and Bronchi**: The trachea is centered, and the bronchi are running normally.\n- **Mediastinum**: The mediastinal structures are not significantly widened or show abnormal density shadows.\n- **Subdiaphragmatic Area**: There is no free gas or fluid level below the diaphragm.",
