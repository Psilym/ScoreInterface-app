  "findings": "- **Overall Chest**: Reduced transparency of both lung fields, with diffuse patchy and nodular shadows, widely distributed and uneven in density.\n- **Both Lungs**: Multiple patchy shadows are visible in both lung fields, some of which are fused, with blurred edges. The main distribution is in the middle and lower lung fields; scattered lesions are also seen in the upper lung fields.\n- **Heart**: The heart size is normal, with no obvious abnormality in shape.\n- **Mediastinum**: The mediastinal structures are clear, with no signs of widening or abnormal density.\n- **Diaphragm**: The diaphragm is smooth, in the correct position, with no significant elevation.\n- **Pleura**: No signs of pleural effusion or pleural thickening are observed.\n- **Bones**: The thoracic cage is symmetrical, with no visible fractures or abnormalities in the ribs, spine, or thoracic vertebrae.",
  "impression": "- **Key Diagnostic Possibilities**:\n  1. **Infectious Lesions**: Such as pneumonia (bacterial, viral, or fungal), which needs to be further clarified based on clinical symptoms and laboratory tests.\n  2. **Interstitial Lung Diseases**: Such as interstitial pneumonia or interstitial lung disease, which needs to be further assessed based on medical history and high-resolution CT.\n  3. **Tumors**: Such as diffuse lung metastases, which needs to be further evaluated based on medical history and additional imaging tests (such as CT or PET-CT).\n  4. **Other Possibilities**: Such as pulmonary edema or alveolar hemorrhage syndrome, which needs to be further ruled out based on clinical manifestations and laboratory tests.",
