  "findings": "- Cardiomegaly with an enlarged cardiac silhouette, suggesting increased cardiac size.\n- Bilateral pulmonary vascular markings appear prominent and dilated, indicating increased pulmonary blood flow.\n- No evidence of pleural effusion or pneumothorax.\n- Lung fields are clear without focal consolidation or infiltrates.\n- Diaphragm is well defined and at normal level bilaterally.\n- No visible abnormalities in the bony thorax or mediastinal structures.\n- Trachea is midline.\n- Heart borders are blurred, particularly at the left cardiac border, consistent with pericardial effusion or cardiomegaly.\n- Pulmonary vasculature is disproportionately prominent relative to lung parenchyma.",
  "impression": "- Likely cardiomegaly with possible associated pulmonary hypertension.\n- Considered differential diagnoses include dilated cardiomyopathy, rheumatic heart disease, or congenital heart disease.\n- Absence of infiltrates or effusions suggests no acute pulmonary infection or fluid overload.\n- Further evaluation with echocardiography is recommended to assess cardiac function and rule out pericardial involvement.\n---",
