  "findings": "- Cardiomegaly with prominent cardiac silhouette, suggesting increased cardiac size.\n- Evidence of pulmonary edema: bilateral perihilar haziness with diffuse bilateral lower lobe opacities, consistent with fluid accumulation in the lung parenchyma.\n- Pleural effusion: moderate right-sided pleural effusion is present, with blunting of the right costophrenic angle and a meniscus sign.\n- Left-sided pleural effusion is not clearly visualized, but the left costophrenic angle appears obscured, possibly due to technical factors or minimal effusion.\n- Mediastinal shift: slight deviation of the trachea to the left, which may be related to volume loss on the right or mass effect.\n- Cardiac silhouette appears to be enlarged, with a cardiothoracic ratio exceeding 0.5, indicating cardiomegaly.\n- No obvious focal consolidation or lung mass is seen.\n- The diaphragm appears flattened, particularly on the right side, which may be secondary to pleural effusion or pulmonary edema.\n- The bony thorax shows no acute fractures or significant deformities.\n- The trachea is midline, but there is a slight leftward deviation, possibly due to right-sided volume loss or mediastinal shift.",
  "impression": "- Likely cardiogenic pulmonary edema secondary to underlying heart disease, given the combination of cardiomegaly, bilateral pulmonary infiltrates, and pleural effusions.\n- Right-sided pleural effusion, which may be complicating the pulmonary edema or representing a separate process such as infection or malignancy.\n- Consideration of concomitant heart failure with reduced ejection fraction or other cardiomyopathy as the primary etiology.\n- Rule out other causes of pulmonary edema, such as acute respiratory distress syndrome or sepsis, although these are less likely without additional clinical context.\n- Recommend further evaluation with echocardiography to assess cardiac function and structure, and consider laboratory studies for BNP or troponin to support diagnosis of heart failure.\n- Monitor for signs of respiratory compromise and consider consultation with cardiology and pulmonology for management.",
