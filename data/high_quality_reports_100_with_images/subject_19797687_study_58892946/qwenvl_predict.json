  "findings": "- **Both Lung Fields**: Diffuse patchy and nodular shadows are present in both lung fields, distributed widely, with uneven density, some of which are fused, showing a \"ground-glass\" appearance.\n- **Upper Right Lung**: A larger nodule is visible, with blurred edges and higher density, accompanied by a halo sign around it.\n- **Mediastinum**: The mediastinal structures are clear, with no significant widening.\n- **Heart**: The heart size is normal, with no obvious abnormalities in shape.\n- **Diaphragm**: The diaphragm is smooth and in its normal position.\n- **Pleura**: No significant pleural effusion, thickening, or signs of pleural effusion is observed on both sides.\n- **Bones**: The thoracic cage is symmetrical, with no obvious fractures or abnormalities in the ribs, spine, or thoracic vertebrae.",
