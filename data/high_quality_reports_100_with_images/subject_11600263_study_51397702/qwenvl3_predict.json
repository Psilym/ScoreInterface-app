  "findings": "- Cardiomegaly with cardiac silhouette measuring approximately 7.5 cm transverse diameter (normal <5.0 cm), suggesting enlargement of the heart.\n- Pulmonary vasculature appears prominent, with increased pulmonary artery and bronchial artery markings, indicating possible pulmonary hypertension or volume overload.\n- Bilateral lower lung fields show increased opacity with hazy, ground-glass appearance, most prominent in the posterior segments, suggestive of interstitial or alveolar infiltrates.\n- No pleural effusions or pneumothorax identified.\n- No obvious consolidation, lobar collapse, or mass lesions.\n- Diaphragm appears flattened, particularly on the right side, consistent with elevated intra-abdominal pressure or chronic lung disease.\n- No visible rib fractures or sternum abnormalities.\n- No mediastinal shift or deviation.\n- Trachea is midline.\n- No calcifications or foreign bodies detected.",
  "impression": "- Cardiomegaly with possible congestive heart failure.\n- Bilateral pulmonary infiltrates consistent with interstitial pneumonia or pulmonary edema.\n- Elevated pulmonary vascular markings suggestive of pulmonary hypertension or left ventricular dysfunction.\n- Consider chronic lung disease or volume overload states.",
