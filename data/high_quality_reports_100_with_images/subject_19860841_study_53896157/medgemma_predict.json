  "findings": ":**\n\n*   **Right Lung:** There is a large, ill-defined opacity in the right upper lobe, extending towards the hilum. This opacity appears to be a combination of consolidation and possibly mass-like features, with some areas of cavitation or necrosis suggested by lucencies within the consolidation. There is also evidence of associated volume loss in the right hemithorax, indicated by elevation of the right hemidiaphragm and rightward shift of the mediastinum.\n*   **Left Lung:** The left lung appears relatively clear, although there might be subtle patchy opacities in the left lower lobe.\n*   **Pleura:** No significant pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified.\n*   **Mediastinum:** The mediastinum is slightly shifted to the right.\n*   **Bones:** No acute bony abnormalities are seen.\n\n**",
