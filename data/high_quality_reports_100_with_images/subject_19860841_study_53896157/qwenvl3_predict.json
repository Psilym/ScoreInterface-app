  "findings": "- Cardiomegaly with a cardiothoracic ratio exceeding 50%, suggesting an enlarged heart.\n- Bilateral pulmonary infiltrates, predominantly peripheral and basilar, with patchy opacities and areas of consolidation, most prominent in the lower lobes.\n- Evidence of pleural effusion, particularly on the left side, with blunting of the left costophrenic angle and a meniscus sign.\n- Increased vascular markings in both lung fields, consistent with pulmonary congestion.\n- Mediastinal shift is not apparent; trachea remains midline.\n- No visible pneumothorax or subcutaneous emphysema.\n- No obvious bony abnormalities or fractures.\n- Presence of medical devices: a central venous catheter (likely right subclavian) and ECG leads.",
  "impression": "- Likely acute or chronic heart failure with pulmonary edema and left-sided pleural effusion.\n- Possible community-acquired pneumonia with superimposed pulmonary edema.\n- Consideration of other causes of bilateral infiltrates including sepsis, pulmonary embolism, or interstitial lung disease, though less likely given the cardiomegaly and effusion.\n---",
