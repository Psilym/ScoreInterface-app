  "findings": "- Cardiomegaly with a cardiothoracic ratio exceeding 50%, suggesting an enlarged heart silhouette.\n- Increased pulmonary vascular markings bilaterally, particularly prominent in the upper lung zones, indicating pulmonary venous congestion.\n- Blunting of the costophrenic angles bilaterally, with mild pleural effusion suggested on the right side.\n- Mildly elevated diaphragm on the right, with a slight shift of the mediastinum toward the left.\n- No evidence of pneumothorax or significant consolidation.\n- No acute bone abnormalities or foreign bodies visible.\n- No significant mediastinal widening or lymphadenopathy.",
  "impression": "- Likely congestive heart failure with pulmonary venous congestion and mild right-sided pleural effusion.\n- Cardiomegaly consistent with chronic volume overload or dilated cardiomyopathy.\n- Consider evaluation for underlying etiology including hypertension, valvular heart disease, or ischemic heart disease.\n- Recommend further assessment with echocardiography and cardiac biomarkers.",
