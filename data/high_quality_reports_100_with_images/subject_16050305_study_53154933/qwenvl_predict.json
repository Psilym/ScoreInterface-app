  "findings": "- **Overall Chest**: Both lung fields show normal transparency with no obvious pneumothorax or mediastinal shift.\n- **Lung Fields**:\n  - Both lung fields exhibit increased and disordered lung markings, particularly prominent in the lower lobes.\n  - There are patchy, hazy areas of increased density in the lower lobes of both lungs, with unclear borders, suggesting possible inflammation or infectious lesions.\n  - The density in the right lower lobe is more pronounced than in the left lower lobe.\n- **Heart**: The heart size and shape are normal, with no signs of significant enlargement or pericardial effusion.\n- **Diaphragm**: The diaphragm appears smooth and in its normal position, with no signs of elevation or paradoxical movement.\n- **Ribs and Chest Wall**: The ribs are intact without any fractures or abnormal calcifications.\n- **Mediastinum**: The mediastinal structures are normal, with the trachea in the midline.\n- **Subdiaphragmatic Area**: There is no free air or fluid levels under the diaphragm, and the abdominal cavity shows no significant abnormalities.",
  "impression": "**Key Diagnostic Possibilities**:\n1. **Pneumonia**: The patchy density in the lower lobes of both lungs is consistent with the imaging features of pneumonia. Further clarification is needed by combining clinical symptoms and laboratory tests.\n2. **Pulmonary Infection**: The increased density shadows suggest an infectious lesion. It is necessary to rule out bacterial, viral, or other pathogen infections.\n3. **Pulmonary Atelectasis or Consolidation**: This needs to be further investigated with a history and additional examinations (such as a chest CT) to exclude pulmonary atelectasis or consolidation.\n4. **Other**: Other possible lung lesions need to be ruled out, such as pulmonary edema, lung nodules, or tumors.\n\nIt is recommended to combine clinical symptoms, laboratory tests, and further imaging examinations (such as a chest CT) to confirm the diagnosis.",
